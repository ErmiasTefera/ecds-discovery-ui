# Product Context: Discovery UI

## Problem Statement
Researchers and academics face significant fragmentation when searching for scholarly resources. They must navigate multiple platforms—library catalogs, institutional repositories, subscription databases, and open-access archives—each with different interfaces, search capabilities, and user experiences. This fragmentation creates:
- Inefficient research workflows with repetitive searches
- Missed relevant resources across different platforms
- Time wasted learning and navigating different interfaces
- Inconsistent search experiences and feature availability
- Difficulty maintaining search context across platforms
- Challenges in organizing and citing discovered resources

## Solution Vision
Discovery UI provides a unified, intelligent gateway that aggregates scholarly resources into a single, cohesive search and discovery platform. The application empowers users to discover, filter, analyze, and access academic materials from multiple sources through one professional interface that adapts to their preferences and workflow needs.
