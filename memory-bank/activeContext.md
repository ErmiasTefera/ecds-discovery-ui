# Active Context: Discovery UI

## Current Project State
The Discovery UI project is in early development phase with basic Next.js infrastructure set up but core functionality not yet implemented. The project has a clear product specification but requires significant development work to achieve the outlined goals.

## What Exists Currently

### Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Next.js Project**: Bootstrapped with App Router structure
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Fully configured with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS**: Set up with Tailwind 4 and utility classes
- **Component Architecture**: Basic component files created
- **Layout System**: TopNavigation and Footer components structured
- **Routing**: App Router structure with (app) group layout

### Basic Structure ‚úÖ
- **Pages**: Landing, search, and detail page routes exist (minimal implementation)
- **Components**: All required component files created (placeholder implementations)
- **Layout**: Application layout with sticky navigation configured

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Implementation
All core features are currently in placeholder state:

#### Landing Page
- ‚úÖ **Complete Implementation**: Professional hero section with "Discover Scholarly Resources" title, comprehensive subtitle, integrated search component, quick stats, feature showcase with 6 feature cards, and multiple CTAs

#### Search Functionality
- **Search Component**: ‚úÖ Functional implementation with search input, suggestions dropdown, navigation to search page, loading states, clear functionality, and quick search tips
- **Needed**: Enhanced features for search results page:
  - Live type-ahead with debouncing
  - Spelling correction suggestions
  - Advanced keyboard navigation
  - Result highlighting

#### Search Results
- **Current**: Empty component shells
- **Needed**: Full result display with:
  - Pagination controls
  - Export functionality
  - Sort options
  - Result count information

#### Filtering System
- **Current**: Placeholder component
- **Needed**: Complete filter implementation with:
  - Faceted search groups
  - AND/OR logic combinations
  - URL persistence
  - Show more/less functionality

#### Detail Views
- **Current**: Minimal placeholder page
- **Needed**: Rich detail implementation with:
  - Tabbed metadata sections
  - Linked resources
  - Citation information
  - Breadcrumb navigation

#### Layout Components
- **TopNavigation**: ‚úÖ Complete implementation with Discovery UI branding, search icon logo, language switcher with 5 languages, responsive mobile menu, and full accessibility support
- **Footer**: ‚úÖ Complete implementation with Discovery UI branding, copyright with dynamic year, quick links, resources section, contact information, version display, and academic resources notice

## Recent Development Activities
- Initial project setup completed
- Git repository initialized with untracked component files
- Basic routing structure established
- Component file structure created
- ProductInfo.md specification document added

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority (Core Search Flow)
1. **Implement Landing Page**: Hero section with search integration
2. **Build Search Component**: Type-ahead, debouncing, keyboard navigation
3. **Create Search Results Page**: Result display with basic functionality
4. **Implement Detail Page**: Basic resource information display

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
1. **Advanced Filtering**: Faceted search with URL persistence
2. **Loading States**: Skeleton components and progressive loading
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
4. **Enhanced Detail Views**: Tabbed interface with rich metadata

### Lower Priority (Polish & Optimization)
1. **Visual Design**: Implement cohesive design system
2. **Performance Optimization**: Search debouncing and caching
3. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for core functionality

## Development Considerations

### Technical Decisions Needed
- **Search API Integration**: How to connect to actual scholarly databases
- **Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces for search results and metadata
- **State Management**: URL-based state vs. client state for complex filters
- **Performance**: Caching strategy for search results and metadata

### Design Decisions Needed
- **Visual Identity**: Color scheme, typography, and component styling
- **User Flow**: Navigation patterns and information architecture
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile-first design implementation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance strategy

## Current Blockers
- No actual data sources connected (using mock data for development)
- Component implementations are placeholder-only
- No design system or visual identity established
- Missing core search and filtering logic

## Success Metrics for Current Phase
- ‚úÖ Basic project structure and routing
- üîÑ Functional search interface with type-ahead
- üîÑ Working search results display
- üîÑ Basic resource detail views
- üîÑ Responsive layout implementation
- üîÑ URL-based state management for search/filters
